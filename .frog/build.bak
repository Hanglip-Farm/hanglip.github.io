We started small, in the spirit of \"<strong>Let&rsquo;s begin something we can finish</strong>\", partly because of the pandemic. Maybe related to that, a duo from Dawid&rsquo;s family found themselves unemployed and gravitated back to their families on the farm. They planted out the Stud Camp in a couple of days. Luckily that helped to fill a gap until, surprisingly in a pandemic, they both found jobs. So, while it&rsquo;s difficult to say &ldquo;we had the labour&rdquo;, it was false to say we didn&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>On paper, we didn&rsquo;t, nor did we have a budget. Looming in the near future was a complete change in the way Hanglip was to be operated, and there was no money to throw at anything. So, although we wanted leguminous carob, lucerne and tamarind trees, it became a matter of \"<strong>invaders aside, any tree is a good tree</strong>\". Horticulturist Nicholas&rsquo;s nursery riches were plundered. A mix of fruit, nut and other trees was transplanted, the bonus being these trees had all already survived winter here, and we think they will again. They had been propogated and potted over time by Nicholas, because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what he does&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>It would be posh to call it &ldquo;alley cropping&rdquo;, yet, but that is the model. Some rows of trees were planted, with the rows between those planted to cucurbits. The cucurbits did not need much attention: two weeks watering until the summer rains took over. Left alone from the onset of the rains, they flourished and we reaped a good harvest from the two rows planted:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/pampoene.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500 pixels;\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/butternuts.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500 pixels;\" /></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"arrivals\">Arrivals</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"jon-and-shane\">Jon and Shane</h2>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s welcoming IT specialist networkers Jon and Shane, who now occupy the Werfgebou.

It has been said elsewhere in this blog that learners will eventually learn to prepare HTML documents. Word processors like Microsoft Word, Word Perfect (anyone remember that? It was better than Word by far, and version 5.1 was so good, it was used to typeset Toverberg Indaba) and LibreOffice Write will be quietly shoved aside, and learners will soon be asked to produce digital documents. It follows that soon after that, they will start to save these on web pages provided on a school server.</p>\n\n<p> In the postal economy, back in colonial days, the chief requirement for getting hired was good handwriting. Today, working nearly anywhere means working on a computer. Civil Servants still write exams for promotion. In handwriting days, some percentage of marks were given for good handwriting and presentation. Not too far down the road, their HTML presentation skills will be marked instead.</p>\n\n<p> At school, Instead of email attachments, URL links will allow the teachers to access work. Nice - no need to carry piles of paper home to mark - just access the school server.</p>\n\n<p> This elevates the importance of internet access, so some schools will need to up their game. Good. A lot has been said about creating &ldquo;good&rdquo; jobs for people, and system admins don&rsquo;t have to be programmers. Just keeping a server going is not that hard, it&rsquo;s only when looking after crucial databases comes into the picture that administration becomes very specialised.</p>\n\n<p> The South African government, soon after 1994, announced that it intended to use open source. Now and then, they still <strong>say</strong> it, but haven&rsquo;t <strong>done</strong> it. Every worker facing the public in any government office I have ever seen is working in Windows. All that money goes to Microsoft! Never mind, though, after Covid&ndash;19, as DM says, everything will change, and it will sink in that <strong>everything is going to the World Wide Web</strong>. If the government has any nous at all, it will put a lot of money into this easier level of IT management.</p>\n\n<p> This blog post is created in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20is%20a%20lightweight%20markup,using%20a%20plain%20text%20editor.\"><strong>Markdown</strong></a>, a document formatting method that is very easy to learn. It is converted automatically to HTML by our blogging platform. School learners learn Markdown in a few mornings, and are comfortable with it within a week. Markdown converters are all over the web, and most programming languages have a library that can easily be imported to do the job. YouTube has many clips about Markdown.</p>\n\n<p> We think touch typing and Markdown is the way things will go, and that&rsquo;s why we started this challenge. Bottom line is: smartphones are consumer devices. They are good for response, but not preparation or development. The smallest device convenient for real work is a tablet, unless the long expected phone docks take off, where one will dock a smartphone into a screen and keyboard setup. Voice typing is very good these days, but a keyboard is a must for editing.</p>")) ((p+ #"c:\\Users\\jazco\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\hanglip.github.io\\_src\\posts\\2022-04-19-long-time.md" . windows) f post (u .

Thankfully, almost any tarred road has cellphone tower reach, making it easy to direct emergency help to the spot you stand on. Or to within three metres of it. The response operator should ask &ldquo;What are your three words?&rdquo;. Whip out your smartphone, open <em><strong>What3Words</strong></em>, and reel off the three dot separated words you find in the text area at the top.

They can even find you off the beaten track if you find you have cell coverage therein your favourite bundu bash.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you have not already done so, before you hit the highway, download the app, play with it to familiarise yourself with it.

It was later decided there was no need for <em>any side</em> to fight for Delville Wood. Now, you know why old-timers refused to speak about the war. Apart from trauma, there was the terrible knowledge that it was not clear (other than &ldquo;they just wanted to fight&rdquo;) what the fight was all about, and it was even less clear that the generals knew what they were doing. It was a colossal, senseless waste of everything, not least four long years. Even undertakers lost out, because various governments couldn&rsquo;t even begin to figure out the final logisitic of how to get twenty million bodies back to their homes.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from those millions from all over the world who lost their lives, thousands of square miles all over the world were damaged. The Ardennes, a vast woodland, comprising the better part of Belgium, as well as large parts of France and Germany, was left bare of foliage, even stripped of branches. Many trees were uprooted by explosives, or burnt to the ground. Nearly every creature previously at home in those trees vanished, mostly vapourised. Millions of tons of lead and other poisonous munition metal were buried in the forests and grasslands.</p>\n\n<p>It is unfathomable, when one realises most of our medicines come from trees and plants, what a sacrilege this was. It took more than half a century for them to recover, and recovery itself was not at a decent pace until, as one old man in Flanders put it, <strong>&ldquo;they managed to get the birds back&rdquo;</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>One day, science will prove (his and) Jasper&rsquo;s theory: that trees do not grow well without birdsong. Those growth rings in the tree trunks we cut down mark the passage of years, but they will also prove to be a vibrant record of the subtle seasonal bird songs themselves. Sound etches those rings, as it did the grooves in vinyl records!</p>\n\n<p>With Covid&ndash;19 quietening the planet, scientists are finding out all sorts of things. One is that the earthâ€™s crust, particularly sensitive to the movement of tectonic plates as well as our noisy vibrations, started to move less, allowing detectors to possibly <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHNMgFjWNvKwZsjJShTwDtcchP\">spot smaller earthquakes and volcanic activity.</a>.

England, although there was no apartheid, nor any segregation in law, was a toxic place where banks were &ldquo;mysteriously&rdquo; unable to advance mortgage loans to black West Indian immigrants. So, the workers at this plant started a loan club. They worked out &ldquo;how many people&rdquo;, contributing &ldquo;how many pounds&rdquo;, for &ldquo;how many weeks&rdquo; from their wages, would take &ldquo;how long to pay cash for a house&rdquo;. The money was calculated, saved and used, and inside a decade, every &ldquo;loan clubber&rdquo; at this factory bought a house, paid for in cash.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Putting it another way, because of their &hellip; racism?, banks cost themselves the opportunity to earn interest on several hundred houses, and saved thousands for the imigrants who paid cash for their properties in Harlesden.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>This was at a time when &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; (read Fascist?) Enoch Powell would bluster &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to live next to one&rdquo; and so on, but Harlesden did not make a name for itself as a hotbed of crime or whatever. It quietly continued as a middle class residential area. Once people owned houses, banks found themselves &ldquo;able&rdquo; to loan money to the new residents. As usual with banks and loans, they only have money to lend when you don&rsquo;t need it. The immigrant workers continued using loan clubs, patiently waiting for their payout turn to purchase cars, alter houses, and so on.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>In practice, what were the details? Let&rsquo;s say a Harlesden house sold for 2500 pounds back then. Weekly wages were around 8 pounds without overtime. The decision was they could afford to put 3 pounds per week into the loan club, and out of a total workforce of 850 people, there are 400 in the loan club. That&rsquo;s 1200 pounds per week. Three weeks amounts to 3600 pounds, enough to pay for a house cash, with 900 poounds left over for expenses like electricity, bond charges, whatever. A house can be saved for bought and paid for, every three weeks. 400 members = 400 weeks. Divide by 52. That&rsquo;s slightly less than 8 years.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>So, wording it another way, in 8 years, 400 people own a fully paid up house. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>Bad luck, racist banks!

It <strong>sounds</strong> easy, when you read Widipedia. Long ago,trying to evince what a wiki was all about (convinced back then it stood for <em>What I Know Is</em>), and despite his years of programming in Pascal and its namby-pamby descendant, VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), Jasper could not just dive in and do the democratic, wiki, writing, <strong>thing</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that there is any codified mystery to it. That&rsquo;s not the impedance at all. The impedance for him was <em>why would anyone want to do this?</em></p>\n\n<p>Lately, though, we can see a possible purpose. Taking Hanglip for an example, and supposing just for a minute that, on being sold, the sale is to a buyer who is totally ignorant of the lie of the Hanglip land. Now, let&rsquo;s once again, that the staff of Hanglip are literate, keen on writing, and computer-savvy. These are just the very ingredients it would take to knock up a wiki as a <strong>knowledge base of Hanglip</strong>, for the new owner(s).</p>\n\n<p>Now, fly on the wall, we check out the owner&rsquo;s eager intent. We see the him sit down at his trusty laptop.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p><em>&ldquo;Hanglip - the part I played in its downfall&rdquo;</em> he mutters, and chortles. Taking a sip of coffee, and dunking a rusk (Ouma&rsquo;s recipe), he opens the wiki file created by his trusty side-man. They have walked a literary and activist path for close to sixty years. And now, the owner is asked for his email address. That&rsquo;s second nature. In it goes. Next, he is asked by the malevolent graphomania basking on the screen to enter his <em>password</em>.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>He stares at the screen. <em>What the Actual</em> &hellip; ? He has been using his email for decades, without ever yet being asked for a password. He can&rsquo;t remember it, and can&rsquo;t even <em>begin</em> to work out how to find out what it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And, there you have it. That&rsquo;s the end of collaborating online</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>When one has grown up writing, spent decades on newspapers, and steeped oneself in printing and paper, not once has any such thing as a <em>password</em> entered upon the scene. The trouble is, passwords and secrecy are an anathema to this man, who without knowing it, is a born hacker. Hackers hate secrets. They are not happy unless they are breaking open padlocks, software vaults, government spook archives, anything secret. This man is as radical as them.</p>\n\n<p>Passowrds, though, are the way of computers. Back in the day they were about costs, not privacy. Computer time was hideously expensive, and one had to book time on a computer. For this, the notion of &ldquo;user accounts&rdquo; came about, so that users&rsquo; computer dalliance could be tracked, and charged for.</p>\n\n<p><em>Bean counters rule</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Here we have the <em>single main impedance</em> to natural writing (or anything) on computer, something that either stymies or raises the hackles, or both, of a person who for years wrote freely on good old paper. Back in the day, we pulled out a typewriter and got cracking. No passwords. And we didn&rsquo;t care about all the trees we used. In the early, innocent days of MS-DOS, it was the same. Load, (<em>beep</em>) and type.</p>\n\n<p>The old mainframe and <strong>Unix</strong> preoccupation with passwords for accounting purposes morphed into a more sinister need: the weakness of the MS-DOS (so-called) Operating System was an open invitation to virus writers at first, and then to <strong>crackers</strong>. Here, I don&rsquo;t mean American white people. &lsquo;Crackers&rsquo; are the &lsquo;bad hackers&rsquo;. Hackers are super-clever with computers, and like prying things open. The &lsquo;cracker&rsquo; takes things a step further, also opening things, but concentrates on bank accounts, which they then set about <strong>emptying of their hard-saved lucre</strong>. Or, they hack data for blackmail, or demand a ransom for freeing it up.</p>\n\n<p>So, there went our wiki.</p>\n\n<p>The new owner of the farm will not get the shared knowledge of water reticulation, water cribs and electricity supply points, , internet antennae, windmills and submersible pumps, roads, fences, gates, weirs and dams, in any new fangled way. With the coming of the Internet of Things, this could be gleaned from the stoep, flying camera drones (what fun!) but until then, s/he will clamber into a jeep, bakkie or onto a horse, and set off, doing things the old fashioned way. The best way, according to the Chinese.

Many of them are domestic guest workers in the country; they signed paperwork that says theyâ€™re only here to work in fields, thatâ€™s all, and when theyâ€™re done, they return home.

The so-called efficiencies that have been built into the highly specialized industrial model that we have right now, we are now learning, do not serve us when you have a situation where a single thing that is unpredicted takes out one pillar of the food system, and then the whole thing comes crumbling down. Thatâ€™s not the kind of food system that we need. We need one that is more distributed, meaning that there are more nodes within the food system that can respond in the volumes and quantities and the formats that are necessary for where people are going to be using this food.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Now, a very good example of that is that the farmers that are doing well right now are the so-called small-scale family farmers. These are folks that produce in volumes, and who redistribute in local and regional networks, where they can respond very quickly, to where the schools are now becoming redistribution points for SNAP, for instance, or for school food that needs to be picked up by students that otherwise might not have access to that food, because theyâ€™re not coming to school every day, and so on. Or through farmers markets, another very important redistribution method which is very fungible. So weâ€™re learning that thatâ€™s actually what works; we need to invest more in these kinds of highly distributed systems, and less in the highly concentrated systems.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Probably the single most influential agricultural lobby is the American Farm Bureau Federation. They say they represent farmers, but they actually represent agribusiness.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>And by the way, Iâ€™ll remind everyone that weâ€™re living in a time where, to quote Noam Chomsky a couple of weeks ago, every fiscal conservative is hiding their copy of Ayn Rand and is lining up for benefits from the nanny state. Thereâ€™s a lot of hypocrisy that we need to throw in these peopleâ€™s faces, because thatâ€™s the urgency that the degree of exploitation and dysfunction that weâ€™re living through demands.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We all have different takes on wages.

We find everyone gets down to it with a will, so we prefer to see a person as a <strong>responder</strong>. There is a timetable, or diary, and s/he <em>responds</em> to that time of day. For example, our cows are milked first thing in the morning, before we get into the veld or whatever. So, we resond to that time of the day by milking (just as our response to 10h30 is to have tea!). It follows that it is just as easy to reward people for <em>whom they are</em> as for <em>what they do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Maeder has evolved over the years a <strong>Discretionary Award</strong> system against which people are rewarded for quality as well as quantity. They are rewarded for awareness of issues, for their specialness and their special accomplishments, in place of a dull count of tasks ticked off.</p>"))))

We started small, in the spirit of \"<strong>Let&rsquo;s begin something we can finish</strong>\", partly because of the pandemic. Maybe related to that, a duo from Dawid&rsquo;s family found themselves unemployed and gravitated back to their families on the farm. They planted out the Stud Camp in a couple of days. Luckily that helped to fill a gap until, surprisingly in a pandemic, they both found jobs. So, while it&rsquo;s difficult to say &ldquo;we had the labour&rdquo;, it was false to say we didn&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>On paper, we didn&rsquo;t, nor did we have a budget. Looming in the near future was a complete change in the way Hanglip was to be operated, and there was no money to throw at anything. So, although we wanted leguminous carob, lucerne and tamarind trees, it became a matter of \"<strong>invaders aside, any tree is a good tree</strong>\". Horticulturist Nicholas&rsquo;s nursery riches were plundered. A mix of fruit, nut and other trees was transplanted, the bonus being these trees had all already survived winter here, and we think they will again. They had been propogated and potted over time by Nicholas, because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what he does&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>It would be posh to call it &ldquo;alley cropping&rdquo;, yet, but that is the model. Some rows of trees were planted, with the rows between those planted to cucurbits. The cucurbits did not need much attention: two weeks watering until the summer rains took over. Left alone from the onset of the rains, they flourished and we reaped a good harvest from the two rows planted:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/pampoene.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500 pixels;\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/butternuts.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500 pixels;\" /></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"arrivals\">Arrivals</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"jon-and-shane\">Jon and Shane</h2>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s welcoming IT specialist networkers Jon and Shane, who now occupy the Werfgebou.

Some answers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Simplicity</li>\n <li>Savings</li>\n <li>Unforeseens</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk wants everyone to have internet. For a start, there is no such thing as a Tesla car without internet. They get, and need, updates almost constantly. So Musk says these Starlink antennae will not need specialists to install them. Anyone will be able to.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Tesla sells roofing tiles that collect solar electriciy, and batteries that store it. This will become more common. In South Africa, that means (since Eskom has largely killed itself of as a trustworthy supplier) more and more farmers are going to wean their farms off Eskom, at least in terms of supply to their dwellings. The first thing a criminal wants is to disable your power so you can&rsquo;t get help, so generating your own at your house rules out the bad guys cutting off supply from down the road somewhwere.</p>\n\n<p>Simple electricity and internet installations are the way to go, and DIY power generation will become the norm on farms where 3-phase is not needed for heavy machinery plants.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p><strong>Savings</strong></p>\n\n<p>In our rural situation, this means that any farmer can have very (rather <strong>unbelievably</strong>) fast internet access for the same price or less than now. We will stil need people to climb koppies to erect things, but they won&rsquo;t need to be tech-savvy digital experts.</p>\n\n<p>Some geeky farmers may want to make money by becoming IPs (Internet Providers) for their neighbours. That is, if they wish to kiss their sleep goodbye, because there is no such thing as a trouble-free connection, and users want what they want! Typically, an IP supplies one or more email addresses, and space on a server to store those emails. Some will also host a website for a fee.</p>\n\n<p>Unless one considers the option of the currently very expensive available satellite internet options, Internet has had to be beamed from a copper (think ADSL) or fibre connection, and those are usually found only in towns. Starlink is the first reasonably priced option to share internet <strong>cheaply, rurally</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unforeseeables</strong></p>\n\n<p>Who knows what people will cook up? There will be far easier and cheaper IoT (Internet of Things), including much easier and better feedback from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>cameras at gates, game areas</li>\n <li>water level sensors at drinking points in livestock camps, or JoJo tanks, saving enormous amounts of fossil fuel</li>\n <li>any other sensors (meat freezer rooms?)</li>\n <li>on-farm communications</li>\n <li>moisture content of crop soils (and automatic watering)</li></ul>\n\n<p>There will be possibilities, for hobbies or home industry, with 3D printing - people will download plans for plastic things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>light fittings,</li>\n <li>toys &amp; figurines</li>\n <li>musical instruments (guitar, flute)</li>\n <li>covers for tablets and phones</li>\n <li>gear lever tops and door fittings for cars</li>\n <li>aqua- and hydroponics parts and spares</li></ul>\n\n<p>There will also be new or better opportunities for :</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>farm-stay working (especially in pandemics as right now)</li>\n <li>rural networking and couriers</li>\n <li>shopping (email and fetch), pop-up shops, spazas</li>\n <li>home schooling</li>\n <li>cultural &amp; eco tourism (<strong>What3Words</strong> will allow every tiny rock carving or painting to be easily located, once identified on the app)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>And more &hellip;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think of a phone, filming a herd of sheep urged through a race for counting. Send the film to us on the stoep! Or in our car! Counting sheep is difficult, but we can step through it counting the sheep slowly and carefully (there are apps for that &hellip; an Australian app counts a whole herd of sheep from a drone flying above the flock).</p>\n\n<p>With very fast internet, it will be easier (as people are doing in the pandemic) to perform gigs from home, even together with musicians on the other side of the world, again saving time in cars and thus lots of fossil fuel (not to mention lives: over the big years of live music, 8% of our perfomers lost their lives in motor accidents).</p>\n\n<p> Music venues relying on liquor sales will may shrink or disappear &hellip; but <strong>lounge concerts</strong> will be back (and beamed across the world)!</p>")) ((p+ #"c:\\Users\\jazco\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\hanglip.github.io\\_src\\posts\\2020-11-26-touch-typing.md" . windows) f post (u .

It has been said elsewhere in this blog that learners will eventually learn to prepare HTML documents. Word processors like Microsoft Word, Word Perfect (anyone remember that? It was better than Word by far, and version 5.1 was so good, it was used to typeset Toverberg Indaba) and LibreOffice Write will be quietly shoved aside, and learners will soon be asked to produce digital documents. It follows that soon after that, they will start to save these on web pages provided on a school server.</p>\n\n<p> In the postal economy, back in colonial days, the chief requirement for getting hired was good handwriting. Today, working nearly anywhere means working on a computer. Civil Servants still write exams for promotion. In handwriting days, some percentage of marks were given for good handwriting and presentation. Not too far down the road, their HTML presentation skills will be marked instead.</p>\n\n<p> At school, Instead of email attachments, URL links will allow the teachers to access work. Nice - no need to carry piles of paper home to mark - just access the school server.</p>\n\n<p> This elevates the importance of internet access, so some schools will need to up their game. Good. A lot has been said about creating &ldquo;good&rdquo; jobs for people, and system admins don&rsquo;t have to be programmers. Just keeping a server going is not that hard, it&rsquo;s only when looking after crucial databases comes into the picture that administration becomes very specialised.</p>\n\n<p> The South African government, soon after 1994, announced that it intended to use open source. Now and then, they still <strong>say</strong> it, but haven&rsquo;t <strong>done</strong> it. Every worker facing the public in any government office I have ever seen is working in Windows. All that money goes to Microsoft! Never mind, though, after Covid&ndash;19, as DM says, everything will change, and it will sink in that <strong>everything is going to the World Wide Web</strong>. If the government has any nous at all, it will put a lot of money into this easier level of IT management.</p>\n\n<p> This blog post is created in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20is%20a%20lightweight%20markup,using%20a%20plain%20text%20editor.\"><strong>Markdown</strong></a>, a document formatting method that is very easy to learn. It is converted automatically to HTML by our blogging platform. School learners learn Markdown in a few mornings, and are comfortable with it within a week. Markdown converters are all over the web, and most programming languages have a library that can easily be imported to do the job. YouTube has many clips about Markdown.</p>\n\n<p> We think touch typing and Markdown is the way things will go, and that&rsquo;s why we started this challenge. Bottom line is: smartphones are consumer devices. They are good for response, but not preparation or development. The smallest device convenient for real work is a tablet, unless the long expected phone docks take off, where one will dock a smartphone into a screen and keyboard setup. Voice typing is very good these days, but a keyboard is a must for editing.</p>")) ((p+ #"c:\\Users\\jazco\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\hanglip.github.io\\_src\\posts\\2022-04-19-long-time.md" . windows) f post (u .

England, although there was no apartheid, nor any segregation in law, was a toxic place where banks were &ldquo;mysteriously&rdquo; unable to advance mortgage loans to black West Indian immigrants. So, the workers at this plant started a loan club. They worked out &ldquo;how many people&rdquo;, contributing &ldquo;how many pounds&rdquo;, for &ldquo;how many weeks&rdquo; from their wages, would take &ldquo;how long to pay cash for a house&rdquo;. The money was calculated, saved and used, and inside a decade, every &ldquo;loan clubber&rdquo; at this factory bought a house, paid for in cash.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Putting it another way, because of their &hellip; racism?, banks cost themselves the opportunity to earn interest on several hundred houses, and saved thousands for the imigrants who paid cash for their properties in Harlesden.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>This was at a time when &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; (read Fascist?) Enoch Powell would bluster &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to live next to one&rdquo; and so on, but Harlesden did not make a name for itself as a hotbed of crime or whatever. It quietly continued as a middle class residential area. Once people owned houses, banks found themselves &ldquo;able&rdquo; to loan money to the new residents. As usual with banks and loans, they only have money to lend when you don&rsquo;t need it. The immigrant workers continued using loan clubs, patiently waiting for their payout turn to purchase cars, alter houses, and so on.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>In practice, what were the details? Let&rsquo;s say a Harlesden house sold for 2500 pounds back then. Weekly wages were around 8 pounds without overtime. The decision was they could afford to put 3 pounds per week into the loan club, and out of a total workforce of 850 people, there are 400 in the loan club. That&rsquo;s 1200 pounds per week. Three weeks amounts to 3600 pounds, enough to pay for a house cash, with 900 poounds left over for expenses like electricity, bond charges, whatever. A house can be saved for bought and paid for, every three weeks. 400 members = 400 weeks. Divide by 52. That&rsquo;s slightly less than 8 years.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>So, wording it another way, in 8 years, 400 people own a fully paid up house. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>Bad luck, racist banks!

It <strong>sounds</strong> easy, when you read Widipedia. Long ago,trying to evince what a wiki was all about (convinced back then it stood for <em>What I Know Is</em>), and despite his years of programming in Pascal and its namby-pamby descendant, VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), Jasper could not just dive in and do the democratic, wiki, writing, <strong>thing</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that there is any codified mystery to it. That&rsquo;s not the impedance at all. The impedance for him was <em>why would anyone want to do this?</em></p>\n\n<p>Lately, though, we can see a possible purpose. Taking Hanglip for an example, and supposing just for a minute that, on being sold, the sale is to a buyer who is totally ignorant of the lie of the Hanglip land. Now, let&rsquo;s once again, that the staff of Hanglip are literate, keen on writing, and computer-savvy. These are just the very ingredients it would take to knock up a wiki as a <strong>knowledge base of Hanglip</strong>, for the new owner(s).</p>\n\n<p>Now, fly on the wall, we check out the owner&rsquo;s eager intent. We see the him sit down at his trusty laptop.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p><em>&ldquo;Hanglip - the part I played in its downfall&rdquo;</em> he mutters, and chortles. Taking a sip of coffee, and dunking a rusk (Ouma&rsquo;s recipe), he opens the wiki file created by his trusty side-man. They have walked a literary and activist path for close to sixty years. And now, the owner is asked for his email address. That&rsquo;s second nature. In it goes. Next, he is asked by the malevolent graphomania basking on the screen to enter his <em>password</em>.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>He stares at the screen. <em>What the Actual</em> &hellip; ? He has been using his email for decades, without ever yet being asked for a password. He can&rsquo;t remember it, and can&rsquo;t even <em>begin</em> to work out how to find out what it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And, there you have it. That&rsquo;s the end of collaborating online</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>When one has grown up writing, spent decades on newspapers, and steeped oneself in printing and paper, not once has any such thing as a <em>password</em> entered upon the scene. The trouble is, passwords and secrecy are an anathema to this man, who without knowing it, is a born hacker. Hackers hate secrets. They are not happy unless they are breaking open padlocks, software vaults, government spook archives, anything secret. This man is as radical as them.</p>\n\n<p>Passowrds, though, are the way of computers. Back in the day they were about costs, not privacy. Computer time was hideously expensive, and one had to book time on a computer. For this, the notion of &ldquo;user accounts&rdquo; came about, so that users&rsquo; computer dalliance could be tracked, and charged for.</p>\n\n<p><em>Bean counters rule</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Here we have the <em>single main impedance</em> to natural writing (or anything) on computer, something that either stymies or raises the hackles, or both, of a person who for years wrote freely on good old paper. Back in the day, we pulled out a typewriter and got cracking. No passwords. And we didn&rsquo;t care about all the trees we used. In the early, innocent days of MS-DOS, it was the same. Load, (<em>beep</em>) and type.</p>\n\n<p>The old mainframe and <strong>Unix</strong> preoccupation with passwords for accounting purposes morphed into a more sinister need: the weakness of the MS-DOS (so-called) Operating System was an open invitation to virus writers at first, and then to <strong>crackers</strong>. Here, I don&rsquo;t mean American white people. &lsquo;Crackers&rsquo; are the &lsquo;bad hackers&rsquo;. Hackers are super-clever with computers, and like prying things open. The &lsquo;cracker&rsquo; takes things a step further, also opening things, but concentrates on bank accounts, which they then set about <strong>emptying of their hard-saved lucre</strong>. Or, they hack data for blackmail, or demand a ransom for freeing it up.</p>\n\n<p>So, there went our wiki.</p>\n\n<p>The new owner of the farm will not get the shared knowledge of water reticulation, water cribs and electricity supply points, , internet antennae, windmills and submersible pumps, roads, fences, gates, weirs and dams, in any new fangled way. With the coming of the Internet of Things, this could be gleaned from the stoep, flying camera drones (what fun!) but until then, s/he will clamber into a jeep, bakkie or onto a horse, and set off, doing things the old fashioned way.

And theyâ€™re cravenly taking advantage of the fact that, for all the reasons that I just described, these are people that are politically invisible; they donâ€™t have muscle. Many of them are domestic guest workers in the country; they signed paperwork that says theyâ€™re only here to work in fields, thatâ€™s all, and when theyâ€™re done, they return home. Or else theyâ€™re not documented, and so what are they going to do when theyâ€™re exploited? Sue? They have no standing, and so thatâ€™s being cravenly exploited.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>We need a food system that is fungible, that has redundancy built in. The so-called efficiencies that have been built into the highly specialized industrial model that we have right now, we are now learning, do not serve us when you have a situation where a single thing that is unpredicted takes out one pillar of the food system, and then the whole thing comes crumbling down. Thatâ€™s not the kind of food system that we need. We need one that is more distributed, meaning that there are more nodes within the food system that can respond in the volumes and quantities and the formats that are necessary for where people are going to be using this food.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Now, a very good example of that is that the farmers that are doing well right now are the so-called small-scale family farmers. These are folks that produce in volumes, and who redistribute in local and regional networks, where they can respond very quickly, to where the schools are now becoming redistribution points for SNAP, for instance, or for school food that needs to be picked up by students that otherwise might not have access to that food, because theyâ€™re not coming to school every day, and so on. Or through farmers markets, another very important redistribution method which is very fungible. So weâ€™re learning that thatâ€™s actually what works; we need to invest more in these kinds of highly distributed systems, and less in the highly concentrated systems.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Probably the single most influential agricultural lobby is the American Farm Bureau Federation. They say they represent farmers, but they actually represent agribusiness.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>And by the way, Iâ€™ll remind everyone that weâ€™re living in a time where, to quote Noam Chomsky a couple of weeks ago, every fiscal conservative is hiding their copy of Ayn Rand and is lining up for benefits from the nanny state. Thereâ€™s a lot of hypocrisy that we need to throw in these peopleâ€™s faces, because thatâ€™s the urgency that the degree of exploitation and dysfunction that weâ€™re living through demands.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We all have different takes on wages. Farming is tougher than most occupations &hellip; shall we say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>\"Harvest is seasonal, wages are <strong>every week</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>You see the problem. It is, for example, one of the problems with permacture: whereas a wool producer knows when s/he will shear, and more or less when and what s/he will be paid, there are few permaculture applications allowing predictable income. It is not <em>impossible</em> to plan, just rare to see permaculture entities that <em>do</em> &lsquo;plan for the bank&rsquo;. If you want to loan money from a bank, something that most farmers need to do to pay wages while waiting for money, you have to know and say when you will honour the debt.</p>")) ((p+ #"c:\\Users\\jazco\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\hanglip.github.io\\_src\\posts\\2020-05-25-work-semantics.md" . windows) f post (u .

Soon after that, he published earnings of all employed there, for all to see. It <em>did</em> narrow the wage gap, but having people swap roles and jobs for a time resulted in mutual respect. Floor sweepers notably did not in the slightest wish to ever attempt to understand upper management roles, (nor even covet their salary levels) after trying to perform in upper management!</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of decolonising, and as we enter 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution) can we replace some tired old industrial words? What about using:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>doer</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>maker</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>chatter</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>decider</p></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>DOER (Do-er)</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is someone who does &lsquo;more of the same&rsquo; (and is arguably happy with that) daily. S/he is happy with learning new things from time to time, but unhappy with taking on too much complexity. It replaces wordls like &lsquo;labourer&rsquo;, &lsquo;worker&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MAKER</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is someone who is also a doer, but tends to put something new into action. S/he is a creator but not necessarily a designer (only). It replaces a word like &lsquo;implementer&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CHATTER</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a playful communicator, who prefers the world of ideas, and loves to juggle them and come up with solutions for (sometimes radical and/or new) things. S/he tends to move around a lot, and to ask &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;why&rdquo;. These people need to own and enjoy chatting and the value of lightness and play, instead of being guiltily glued to a desk &ldquo;looking busy&rdquo;! Chatter replaces &lsquo;communicator&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DECIDER</strong></p>\n\n<p>This a person happiest when s/he has to decide things. S/he has in the first place, the very precious skill of <strong>listening</strong> and the equally special skills of empathy, understanding and <strong>&ldquo;response-ability&rdquo;</strong>. Decider replaces &lsquo;manager&rsquo; and &lsquo;co-ordinator&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWARENESS, QUALITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>In all four of these positions, we feel it most important to foster and reward &ldquo;awareness&rdquo;. If people <em>understand</em> that there is poverty, and why and where it comes from, they have half a chance to help us free people from it. Being unaware of it tends to go hand in hand with <em>accepting it as inevitable</em> (nearly always wrong). in the 1980s, a negotiator tackled a worker question, about &ldquo;transformation not happening soon enough&rdquo; by promptly asking &ldquo;what are <strong>you</strong> doing to bring about transformation?&rdquo;! These things are for all of us to do, in our own ways. We believe if someone has a better understanding of issues, s/he is better placed to deal with them, and less inclined to leave thenm to someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RESPONSE-ABILITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>Working is a given. We find everyone gets down to it with a will, so we prefer to see a person as a <strong>responder</strong>. There is a timetable, or diary, and s/he <em>responds</em> to that time of day. For example, our cows are milked first thing in the morning, before we get into the veld or whatever. So, we resond to that time of the day by milking (just as our response to 10h30 is to have tea!). It follows that it is just as easy to reward people for <em>whom they are</em> as for <em>what they do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Maeder has evolved over the years a <strong>Discretionary Award</strong> system against which people are rewarded for quality as well as quantity. They are rewarded for awareness of issues, for their specialness and their special accomplishments, in place of a dull count of tasks ticked off.</p>"))))
